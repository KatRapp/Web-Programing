			<p> I have lived in Lamoni for about 2 years now. I would never image myself being here if it wasn't for school.
			The reason is because its small and not much to do which is one of negatives of living here.One of the positives is the connections you make while here.
			Also,being in a small town its quiet,peaceful and friendly.Friends I'm making here have became family. 
			I've made so many connections already and hope for many more. The skills I have learned are the best ones yet.
			Memories that will last forever!
